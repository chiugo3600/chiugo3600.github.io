    <p>Laguna Beach is in Orange County between Los Angeles and San Diego. There are many small and separate beaches that you can visit at Laguna such as 1000 step beach and Fisherman's Cove. When I went I visited the main beach and it was beautiful  I also visited the tide pools where you can see sea animals when the tide is low. There are also some shopping areas around the beach  <a href= "https://www.visitlagunabeach.com/">Learn More About Laguna beach</a></p>
