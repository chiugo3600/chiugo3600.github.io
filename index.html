    <p>Laguna Beach is in Orange County between Los Angeles and San Diego. There are many small and separate beaches that you can visit at Laguna such as 1000 step beach and Fisherman's Cove. When I went I visited the main beach and it was beautiful but there is a lot of walking you have to do to get to the beach you want to see. I also visited the tide pools where you can see sea animals when the tide is low. There are also some shopping areas around the beach where I got cookies and cream ice Cream. <a href= "https://www.visitlagunabeach.com/">Learn More About Laguna beach</a></p>

    <p>San Fransisco is located in Northern California. While I was there I saw the famous Golden Gate bridge and the Oakland Bay bridge (shown in picture above) I also tried clam chowder for the first time!<a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco">Learn More About San Fransisco</a></p>
